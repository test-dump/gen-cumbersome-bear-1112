The requested program is a simple "Hello World" console application written in C#. The application's main purpose is to display the text "Hello, World!" to the console when it is run.

Program Specifications Detailed:

1. Program Details

The application is a standalone C# console application. The application doesn't require any user interaction. It simply displays "Hello, World!" on the console when run.

2. Features

The application has a single feature: 
- Display the text "Hello, World!" to the console.

This feature doesn't require any user input or produce any other output.

3. Details about Program Functionality

Upon being run, the application executes a single function, typically named "Main". This function contains the necessary code to display "Hello, World!" on the console.

4. Core Classes, Functions, Methods

This application, due to its simplicity, doesn't require multiple classes or functions. Below is the single core function for this application:

- `static void Main(string[] args)`: This is the entry point for any C# console application. It doesn't return anything (void) and takes an array of strings (string[] args) as argument. This argument can be used to pass in command line arguments to the application but for the purpose of this application, it won't be used. Inside this function, we will call the Console.WriteLine method to print "Hello, World!" to the console.

5. Dependencies

As the application is extremely simple, it doesn't require any non-standard or third-party dependencies. The only dependencies that will be used are the standard System namespace which is a part of the C# language and provides the Console class for interactions with the console.
