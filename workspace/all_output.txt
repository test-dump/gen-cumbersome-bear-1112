Starting with the entrypoint file, its name will be `Program.cs` where main execution of the program occurs.

Program.cs
```csharp
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
    public static class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
}
```
Briefly explaining the code above, `Main` is the method where the program begins execution. The `Console.WriteLine` is a method of the `Console` class under `System` Namespace. This line writes the string "Hello, World!" and inserts a new line, hence transferring the program control to the next line.

Now we're creating `ProgramTest.cs` file where we will write our tests for the Main function of our console application.

ProgramTest.cs
```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using Xunit;
using HelloWorld;

public class ProgramTest
{
    [Fact]
    public void Main_Writes_HelloWorld()
    {
        var writer = new StringWriter();
        Console.SetOut(writer);

        Program.Main(new string[0]);

        var output = writer.GetStringBuilder().ToString().Trim();
        Assert.Equal("Hello, World!", output);
    }
}
```
In `ProgramTest.cs`, we have the `Main_Writes_HelloWorld` unit test defined. Explaning further, the unit test redirects the `Console.Out` to a `StringWriter` instance and then calls the `Program.Main` method which writes `Hello, World!` to the Console's standard output. The test then captures the output and verifies that it is equal to `Hello, World!`.

Please double check if both files with their respective codes are present as per the architecture.

Note: The double quotes around "Hello, World!" are mandatory in C# for String literals.
